In this project, I have made a simulator for different problems faced in working of an OS.
This includes problems such as:
  1. Dining philosopher's problem
  2. Peterson's solution
  3. Producer-Consumer problem
  4. Shared lock method
  5. Strict alteration method

The code for the same has been written in JavaScript and HTML, CSS have been used for styling the webpages
